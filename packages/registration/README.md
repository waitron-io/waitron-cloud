# Registration state

This internal package stores an installation's approved connection to an organisation
and legal business. PostgreSQL transactions coordinate workers, so they can retry
completion without creating duplicate venues or installations.

## Trust boundary

You must verify identities and approvals before calling this package. There is no
HTTP endpoint, login flow, proof verifier or credential issuer here. An installation
key identifier, account ID or local receipt ID is a reference, never a credential.
Do not expose these methods directly as public endpoints.

The surrounding service must supply the authenticated installation's canonical key
identifier. The local approval adapter must verify local administrator authority and
issue a unique receipt bound to the complete request. The Cloud approval adapter must
supply the account from its authenticated session. This package also checks the
account's current registration permission in PostgreSQL when approving and completing.

The minimal account and membership tables support that check. Login, platform staff
roles and account lifecycle will come from the planned identity integration using
Waitron's `pre-sqlite-migration` tag; no identity code has been copied yet.

## State and completion

`start(binding)` records the binding after an organisation and legal business have
been selected. The earlier browser journey that selects them is still to be built.
The binding contains an operation UUID, installation key identifier, local venue UUID,
environment, organisation UUID and legal-business UUID. UUIDs use lowercase canonical
text. Key identifiers and environments must already be canonical; this package does
not parse certificates or determine which key formats the protocol will accept.

A request expires after ten minutes, measured by PostgreSQL. This internal default is
subject to the approval protocol's final policy. Repeating `start` never extends it.
An operation ID is scoped to its installation key; changing other binding fields is
an error. A different installation cannot consume the request or its approval receipt.

`approveLocal` and `approveCloud` persist the approvals. For a new registration,
`complete` locks the request, checks both approvals and current permission, and records it in the
same transaction as its venue, installation and service rows. Permission rows remain
locked until commit. Expiry is checked after lock waits using wall time. A completed
request can return its original result after expiry, provided its installation remains
active. Retrieving that recorded result is independent
of the original approver's current permission; it cannot issue credentials or create
another link. New completions always require current Cloud permission.

Local venue UUIDs are unique within an environment in this registry. A conflicting
organisation, legal business or installation is rejected rather than silently taking
over the record. The approval protocol must establish the provenance of that local
identifier; knowing it grants no access. Server replacement and resolving cloned
local identities require a separate flow. An installation key can belong to only one
venue, and this slice permits one installation per venue, including revoked records.
The replacement implementation will need an explicit migration for installation history.

`configuration(authenticatedInstallationKey)` returns only the matching active
installation's registration and three service states. Remote access, continuous
backup and retained snapshots all start as `unconfigured`. This is a state projection;
versioned network configuration, machine credentials and provisioning come later.
A query already in flight may finish as revocation commits. Later queries are denied.

## Development

From the repository root:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

The test command requires Docker. It starts PostgreSQL 18 on a random loopback port,
creates a random test schema and removes its container and volume afterwards. It
never uses `DATABASE_URL`. To use your own disposable PostgreSQL instance, set
`TEST_DATABASE_URL` and run `pnpm test:registration`; that command creates and drops
only its randomly named test schema.

Tests use independent database connections and observe blocked workers through
`pg_stat_activity`. Separate Node processes prove that pending approvals and committed
results survive application restarts. Terminated database connections must reject the
transaction without killing the process, and its pool must remain usable. These are
connection-failure tests, not database failover tests. The application that owns the
pool must also handle its idle-connection `error` events.

To apply the schema to a development database, set `DATABASE_URL` in your shell and run:

```sh
pnpm db:migrate
```

Migrations run in a transaction under a database advisory lock, which makes concurrent
migration runners wait their turn. Applied SQL files are checked against recorded
hashes; add another migration instead of editing a file that has been applied.
The library does not migrate on import or create organisations and accounts for you.
Deployment credentials and database privileges remain to be designed before public use.
